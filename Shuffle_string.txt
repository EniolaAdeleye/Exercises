Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length.

The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.


Example 1:

Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.


Constraints:

s.length == indices.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
s contains only lower-case English letters.
0 <= indices[i] < n
All values of indices are unique (i.e. indices is a permutation of the integers from 0 to n - 1).

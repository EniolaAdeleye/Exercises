A decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.

Given a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = "32"
Output: 3
Explanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32



Constraints:

1 <= n.length <= 105
n consists of only digits.
n does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.
